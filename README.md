## Description
A data research project, exploring global ranking metrics and how they culminate in presentation.

### Scraping
Collected data by scraping Wikipedia entries with lists containing most of the world's countries, using metrics such as:

- population
- gdp
- male to female income ratio
- income inequality
- happiness

(this list is a wip)

### Visualization
The data is then visualized and countries are conneted using a series of sorting methods, with extra sets of 
statistics demarcated by weighted/gradient lines


#### Possible visualization software:

- [Planetary.js](http://planetaryjs.com)
- [PhiloGL](http://www.senchalabs.org/philogl)
- [Processing](https://processing.org)

</br>
## Future goals:

- create a web app
- synthesize data visualization into audio for installation

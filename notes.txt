DOC = dict of countries
LOC = list of countries

TODO:
- upon scrape request, we input most accurate col and offset data, so store it then

- gather multiple lists
- create country dictionary
- create country matching algorithm
- explore various sorting methods (alternating front and back pop, using deque), which then creates duple
- what about connections with more nodes? Truples?
- explore drawing applications

- different weights in lines for the varying disparities
- demarcate the median
- make the connections kinda rubbery, elastic
